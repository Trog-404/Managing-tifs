# Managing-tifs
Noebooks to explore data and metadata structure of tiffs. Moreover a routine to integrate metadata from external files are provided.
## Explanation
This repository contains a notebook to explore the structure of a general tif, gaining insight about the data (i.e. the image array) and the metadata contained into the tags. It is born to analyze electron microscopy  data files. It is specifically useful to understand how to use these files in NOMAD through the plugin https://github.com/Trog-404/Characterization-utilities.git. Anyway it could be in general useful for any kind of tiff. Finally a routine based on the C library ltiff is presented to integrate data into the starting tiff if the process data are stored not directly within the tiff but in an external file.
